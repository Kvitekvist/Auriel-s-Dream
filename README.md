## 2. Installation
Let us start the install process.

### [Prepare your PC for Wabbajack](https://github.com/Kvitekvist/Auriel-s-Dream/wiki/Prepare-PC-for-modlist) (Do this if you do not already have Wabbajack setup)
See this page, if it is your first time installing a Wabbajack list.
It will take you through a process that makes sure WJ can install correctly, that windows will not block any files and how to prevent automatic steam updates for SkyrimVR. All these together makes sure that the install process is the same and goes smoothly for all users.

## 3. Steps to do after Auriel's Dream is installed

### [Activate the Essential Files](https://github.com/Kvitekvist/Auriel-s-Dream/wiki/Essential-Files)

DO NOT RUN LOOT! Everytime you run LOOT a kitten dies and we cry in the corner. The load order is exactly as it should be, do not change it.

This step will add the required files for SKSE, Engine Fixes, DLL loader and other essential files that cannot be handled by MO2.

[Click here](https://github.com/Kvitekvist/Auriel-s-Dream/wiki/Essential-Files) for instructions on how to activate the Essential Files correctly.


### [Choose ENB or Shader](https://github.com/Kvitekvist/Auriel-s-Dream/wiki/ENB-and-ReShader)
Auriel's Dream comes with several presets for both ENB and for ReShade.
There are 3 difference performance indicators in their names. Low means low performance cost, Medium means medium performance cost and High means high performance cost.
[Click here](https://github.com/Kvitekvist/Auriel-s-Dream/wiki/ENB-and-ReShader) for instructions on how to activate/update/change ENB or ReShade.

## 4. How to start up Auriel's Dream

Head over to the installation folder and locate an executable named `ModOrganizer.exe` and launch it. Once its launched there will be a dropdown box on the top right and a big run button next to it. Ensure it is set to "Play" by selecting it in the dropdown box and then hitting the run button.

### Setup VRIK
I made 2 videos for VRIK
1. Setup Weapon Holsters: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTGhQCVcgNE
In this video you learn how you can attach weapons to your avator body in VR. Meaning you can grab a a bow from your back, a sword from your hip and so on.
2. Setup Gestures: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEi7gwN8hgg
Gestures are VERY powerful in VR. By making hand gestures you can instantly equip a spell, weapon or even armor. You can instantly cast spells by waving your hand, or consume potions. Playing this way allows you to avoid opening the menu too frequently.
