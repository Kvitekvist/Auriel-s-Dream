## System Requirements

Minimum system requirements:

Storage Space: 98 GB (rounded uo)

RAM: 32 GB (Or 16GB with a 20GB windows page file) Game uses about 20GB RAM.

CPU: Intel Core i7-7700HQ, 4 cores at 2.80 GHz

GPU: GTX 1660

## Installation
See this page, if it is your first time installing a Wabbajack list.
It will take you through a process that makes sure WJ can install correctly, that windows will not block any files and how to prevent automatic steam updates for SkyrimVR. All these together makes sure that the install process is the same and goes smoothly for all users.

### [Pre-Installation](https://github.com/Kvitekvist/Auriel-s-Dream/wiki/Pre-install)

### [Downloading and Installing](https://github.com/Kvitekvist/Auriel-s-Dream/wiki/Download-and-Installing-the-modlist)
Next step is to download the modlist and install it.

### [Problems with Wabbajack](https://github.com/Kvitekvist/Auriel-s-Dream/wiki/Problems-with-Wabbajack)

## Post-Installation

### Activate the Essential Files

First, run the program named Essentials Files from Mod Organizer 2.
This step will add the required files for SKSE, Engine Fixes, DLL loader and other essential files that cannot be handled by MO2.

Then Click "OK" if you get a message saying something about Failed to check for update. This is ok.

![image](https://i.ibb.co/P5mpMfH/enb2.jpg)

Then navigate to the Presets menu by pressing the symbol in the top left (the three lines). The menu should look like this:

![image](https://i.ibb.co/YkFSZJ1/enb3.jpg)

Finally, activate the two options "Essential Files" and "3D Audio". If they were already on, then turn them off, then on again.
If you need more performance, you skip 3D audio.

Next, place this file in the folder where skyrimvr.exe is located (the steam folder for SkyrimVR):
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1n5ZIV09uDbZnDMvF_imLhrhZCBrhSwdU/view?usp=sharing

### Choose ENB or Shader
From MO2, run the ENB program:

![image](https://i.ibb.co/9YSbjZG/enb1.jpg)

Then Click "OK" if you get a message saying something about Failed to check for update. This is ok.

![image](https://i.ibb.co/P5mpMfH/enb2.jpg)

Then navigate to the Presets menu by pressing the symbol in the top left (the three lines). The menu should look like this:

![image](https://i.ibb.co/YkFSZJ1/enb3.jpg)

Now here, you can choose from a list of different ENB profiles. There are 3 difference performance indicators in their names. Low means low performance cost, Medium means medium performance cost and High means high performance cost. 
If any preset was marked as on, then turn them off, then toggle on the button of your choice. By default, The first option is checked. Uncheck this and then check any of the other options that you would like to test.

### How to start up Auriel's Dream

Head over to the installation folder and locate an executable named `ModOrganizer.exe` and launch it. Once its launched there will be a dropdown box on the top right and a big run button next to it. Ensure it is set to "Play" by selecting it in the dropdown box and then hitting the run button.

### Make the game brighter
Run the ENB program from MO2. Then choose a preset that has the word "Brighter Nights" in it. If the game is still too dark for you, use the VrVIsion preset.

### Setup VRIK
I made 2 videos for VRIK
1. Setup Weapon Holsters: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTGhQCVcgNE
2. Setup Gestures: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEi7gwN8hgg

Check this page for how to update the modlist.

### Optional Gameplay mods

![image](https://i.ibb.co/Yc0vVy3/optional-mods.jpg)

1. MageVR - Popular mod, mostly for the backpack feature and spell gestures.
Not included because: I don't like the background program this mod needs to run. It can get stuck and cause performance issues. VRIK gestures also has a great gesture system.
2. Dual Wield Block VR. 
Not included because (NIB): Not needed unless you play as a dual wield champ. I like to keep "things" to a minimum.
3. Weapon Throw VR. Throw melee weapons, including bound weapons. Very powerful.
NIB: I find it too powerful.
4. VRIK Rift-Index-WMR Controller Bindings. Specific bindings recommended for Rift / Index users.
NIB: Only relevant for some users.
5. Spellsiphon - Immersive Combat. Very powerful and different way of magic gameplay.
NIB: Too powerful and changes the game too much from the Vanilla experience.
6. Dragonborn Speaks Naturally - Use your voice to control dialogues with NPCs.
NIB: Some users struggle to get this working. It also does not seem that most players use voice commands. Keeping active things to a minimum.
7. Ordinator - Perks of Skyrim - For those that want a more advanced perk tree.
NIB: Changes the vanilla game play too much.
8. Apocalypse - Magic of Skyrim - For those who wants way more spells added to the game
NIB: Changes the vanilla game play too much.
9. Apocalypse - Ordinator Compatibility Patch - Needed if you want both mods.
NIB: You need to use both mods above.
10. Simple Realistic Archery VR - You have to draw each arrow manually after each shot.
NIB: I don't find the mod working smoothly enough. If you use this mod, you must make sure that it's plugin is in the top 100 plugins.
11. Harder Dragons Addon - Dragons have MUCH higher stats.
NIB: Changes difficulty significantly against dragons. By default I want the list to be vanilla difficulty.
12. Faster Respawn - Areas reset after only 3 days. Reduces save file bloat and allows for players to clear out dungeons that are already done more frequently.
NIB: I actually recommend having this active as it is good for the save file. But it can be a little exploited by players that just wait 3 days and repeat a cave for easy experience or loot.

### Optional Survival Mode
![image](https://i.ibb.co/5LTCpVt/surivial.jpg)

1. iNeed - Food, Water and Sleep. Very popular mod that makes food much more relevant. Pairs very well with Campire and Frostfall for the ultimate surival experience.
2. Campfire & Frostfall
3. Food effect for Frostfall

### Optional Hard Mode

1. SkyTEST - Harder Creatures SE. Harder creatures in general.
2. High Level Enemies. Harder creatures and they scale to your level.Ã¸
3. Real Bosses. Makes bosses harder.
4. Increased Enemy Spawns SSE No Scripts. 3x more enemies,
5. True Miraak-Harder Miraak. Powers up Miraak.
6. Harder Dragons Addon. Dragons har much harder to take down.
7. Know Your Enemy - Trait-based resistances and weaknesses. You should use different weapon / spell types against different types of enemies.
8. 4. Scarcity SE - Less Loot Mod. Loot becomes much less scares, slowing down your economical growth, and makes finding good treasure much more exciting.
9. Bring Your Silver Lite Vamps Ghosts and Werewolves version - You will need silver weapons to better deal with vampires, ghosts and werewolves!

### [Noteworthy Mods](https://github.com/Kvitekvist/Auriel-s-Dream/wiki/Noteworthy-Mods)

[Here](https://github.com/Kvitekvist/Auriel-s-Dream/wiki/Noteworthy-Mods) you can read more about Mods that are added, that alter the game in some way. If you are new to Auriel's Dream, then I highly recommend that you look into these.

### Removing the Modlist

First, run the 2 programs in MO2 called "ENB" and "Essential Files", and toggle off all the options in the preset. You can now remove the MO2 folder and be done with it.
