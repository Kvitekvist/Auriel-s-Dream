Let us start the install process.

### [Prepare your PC for Wabbajack](https://github.com/Kvitekvist/Auriel-s-Dream/wiki/Pre-install)
See this page, if it is your first time installing a Wabbajack list.
It will take you through a process that makes sure WJ can install correctly, that windows will not block any files and how to prevent automatic steam updates for SkyrimVR. All these together makes sure that the install process is the same and goes smoothly for all users.

## Steps to do after Auriel's Dream is installed

### Activate the Essential Files

First, run the program named Essentials Files from Mod Organizer 2.
This step will add the required files for SKSE, Engine Fixes, DLL loader and other essential files that cannot be handled by MO2.

Then Click "OK" if you get a message saying something about Failed to check for update. This is ok.

Then navigate to the Presets menu by pressing the symbol in the top left (the three lines). The menu should look like this:

Finally, activate the two options "Essential Files" and "3D Audio". If they were already on, then turn them off, then on again.
If you need more performance, you skip 3D audio.

Next, place this file in the folder where skyrimvr.exe is located (the steam folder for SkyrimVR):

### Choose ENB or Shader
From MO2, run the ENB program:

Then Click "OK" if you get a message saying something about Failed to check for update. This is ok.

Then navigate to the Presets menu by pressing the symbol in the top left (the three lines). The menu should look like this:

![image](https://i.ibb.co/YkFSZJ1/enb3.jpg)

Now here, you can choose from a list of different ENB profiles. There are 3 difference performance indicators in their names. Low means low performance cost, Medium means medium performance cost and High means high performance cost. 
If any preset was marked as on, then turn them off, then toggle on the button of your choice. By default, The first option is checked. Uncheck this and then check any of the other options that you would like to test.

### How to start up Auriel's Dream

Head over to the installation folder and locate an executable named `ModOrganizer.exe` and launch it. Once its launched there will be a dropdown box on the top right and a big run button next to it. Ensure it is set to "Play" by selecting it in the dropdown box and then hitting the run button.

### Make the game brighter
Run the ENB program from MO2. Then choose a preset that has the word "Brighter Nights" in it. If the game is still too dark for you, use the VrVIsion preset.

### Setup VRIK
